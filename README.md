# Overview
This Python project presents a dynamic and engaging Balls Collision Simulator, created entirely from scratch, with the exception of a visual library for rendering. The simulation is built upon fundamental physics concepts, such as Newton's laws of motion, and incorporates user control over gravity and friction forces. The project begins with a single ball and expands to include multiple balls, optimized for smooth and realistic interactions.

# Features
- Physics-Based Simulation: The project employs Newton's laws of motion and other physics principles to create a realistic and dynamic simulation of ball collisions.

- User-Controlled Parameters: You can adjust gravity and friction forces within the simulation, allowing for a customized experience and experimentation with different physical scenarios.

- Multi-Ball Interaction: The simulator starts with a single ball and scales to accommodate multiple balls, each interacting with one another dynamically.

- Optimization Algorithms: The project integrates optimization algorithms to ensure smooth and efficient simulation, even with a large number of balls.

# Getting Started
Clone the project and run the main.py.

Usage
Explore the code, tweak the parameters in the globals file, and observe how changes in gravity and friction affect the behavior of the balls.
